I am Australian and was born in Brisbane. Previous to this course, I completed year 12 and have since worked in the dredging industry. In 2019 I worked at Mt. Hotham during the snow season, which was a very different experience for me. I really enjoyed my time at the snow and it allowed me to finally move out of home. After the season concluded, I moved down to Melbourne and am really enjoying the change, especially the colder weather. I have always wanted to learn another language, preferably Italian or Japanese. I absolutely love animals and find all kinds fascinating. My favourite animal is either a White Tiger or a Capuchin Monkey. My favourite sport is basketball, but I really love any sport. Growing up I played rugby league for 11 years and have always enjoyed playing different sports socially. </p1>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p2> I am interested in IT because it is always growing and changing to become better and to make everyday life tasks even easier. I find it so fascinating how we can use devices and machines in such a broad way to help us complete and learn so many different things. IT has always been great source of entertainment for me whether it be music, television or playing video games. I have been interested in IT ever since I was a young kid and playing a lot of video games. I am looking forward to learning more about the mechanics and gain a more in depth knowledge of hardware and software. I don’t have a lot of experience in the IT industry, only what I have previously studied at school, or the tech I use at home such as computers, gaming devices, mobile phones and using POS in retail. 

I am studying through Open University’s Australia which offered me a range of different IT degrees from many universities. RMIT has a great reputation in the IT field and for that reason, I was drawn to studying here. Friends who have completed their degrees at RMIT have reported to me that they received great training, which set them up for their careers in IT. I also enjoy that RMIT offers different specialisations within the degree so I have the option to make my university experience specific to my needs and interests. 


I expect to learn a lot more about the IT industry as a whole, whether it is learning about hardware parts for machines or PCs, software such as programs that are useful for coding or designing websites and learning all of the aspects of the software and how to use them properly. I also want to learn more about coding and how it works and general “smart home” technology. Through learning about all of these different areas, I expect that I will be able to make a decision about which area I am the most interested in and what I need to know to work the field. </p2>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

IT support co-ordinators are responsible for developing, organising and implementing a company’s IT goals. They can provide the organisation general support duties such as monitoring computer performances, providing and installing updates on the work systems, installing software for the technology and could also work on fixing hardware issues. I find this position appealing because I would be able to monitor the companies systems in real time, and fix any issues that arise. I enjoy problem solving tech issues and determining whether it is a hardware or software issue. This job also contains an administrative and managerial side, which I could see myself being successful with as I enjoy working with others and in a team environment. 

Typically, people hired for this job have completed a Bachelor in computer or information science for the mathematics, software development and programming skills required. Not only does it require you to have good knowledge about technology and software, but you will also need to be a good leader with strong communication and organisation skills.

I believe I have good communication skills, however, currently do not have the technology skills yet, which is why I have decided to do this Bachelor of IT. This course and the knowledge and skills taught within it are going to assist me in being able to reach my goal. Further I will work on honing leadership skills throughout the course and beyond to further cement my abilities.
